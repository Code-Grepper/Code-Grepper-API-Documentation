# Logout Vulnerability

You can easily logout users by just making them click a link, you can hide this link in your dontaion link and once someone clicks it they will be logged out of their Code Grepper account. The link is the logout endpoint.

```yaml
# GET
https://www.codegrepper.com/api/logout.php
```
